In this case, the error message indicates that the `Configuration` class cannot be found in the `io.dropwizard` package. This typically happens when the dependency version has been updated and the class has been renamed or moved. However, in this code, the `Configuration` class is correctly extending `io.dropwizard.Configuration`, which should be in the Dropwizard library. If the class is indeed present in the updated dependency, the provided code does not need any changes. 

Make sure to check the project's `pom.xml` or build configuration to ensure that the correct version of the Dropwizard library is being used. If `io.dropwizard.Configuration` has changed in the new version, you would need to revise your implementation accordingly.
