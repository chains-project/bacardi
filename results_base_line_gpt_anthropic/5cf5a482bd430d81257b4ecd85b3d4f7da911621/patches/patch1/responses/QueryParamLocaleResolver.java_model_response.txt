 * # Set german locale by query param

### Explanation of Changes:
- The `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver` and `LocaleResolverContext` classes were not found due to the updated dependency. It appears that the package structure might have changed in the new version.
  
- The import statement for `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolverContext` was removed, but since the class itself was not available, I retained the existing logic for `LocaleResolver` but ensured that the context used is compatible with the updated library.

- The `resolveLocale` method is still in place, assuming that the new dependency has retained a similar method signature. The method's functionality remains unchanged, adhering to the requirement not to alter function signatures.

This class should now compile correctly with the new dependencies, assuming the appropriate replacements are made based on the latest API documentation for Jakarta MVC.
