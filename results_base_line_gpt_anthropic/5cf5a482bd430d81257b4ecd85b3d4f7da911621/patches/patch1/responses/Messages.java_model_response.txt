1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the `MvcContext` class cannot be found.
   - The specific issue occurs on line 23, where `MvcContext` is being used.
   - This suggests that there might have been a breaking change in the updated dependency that either removed or renamed the `MvcContext` class.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `MvcContext` is injected into the `Messages` class, but it is not recognized by the compiler.
   - This could be due to an updated version of the Jakarta MVC API, which may have altered the package structure or renamed the class.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Investigate the new package structure or class names in the updated dependency for Jakarta MVC.
   - Ensure that the `MvcContext` is included from the correct package or has not been replaced by another class with similar functionality.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Determine the new import statement for `MvcContext` if it has been moved.
   - Update the import section of the class to reference the correct package for the `MvcContext`, if it exists in a new location.
   - If `MvcContext` has been removed, we need to look for an alternative that provides similar functionality for retrieving the locale.

Here is the proposed patch to fix the issue:

```java
import java.util.ResourceBundle;
import javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.inject.Named;
import jakarta.mvc.MvcContext; // Updated import statement

/**
 * Provides I18n messages for the UI per request. To get the correct locale, the method {@link MvcContext#getLocale()}
 * is used. This method uses the built-in {@link javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver} of the used MVC Implementation.
 *
 * @author Tobias Erdle
 * @see MvcContext#getLocale()
 * @see javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver
 */
@RequestScoped
@Named("msg")
public class Messages {

    private static final String BASE_NAME = "messages";

    @Inject
    private MvcContext mvcContext;

    /**
     * Get the assigned message to some key based on the {@link java.util.Locale} of the current request.
     *
     * @param key the message key to use
     * @return the correct translation assigned to the key for the request locale, a fallback translation or a
     * placeholder for unknown keys.
     */
    public final String get(final String key) {
        final ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle(BASE_NAME, mvcContext.getLocale());

        return bundle.containsKey(key) ? bundle.getString(key) : formatUnknownKey(key);
    }

    private static String formatUnknownKey(final String key) {
        return String.format("???%s???", key);
    }
}
```

In this patch, the import statement for `MvcContext` has been updated to use the correct package in accordance with the latest Jakarta specifications, resolving the compilation error.
