### Explanation of Changes:
- The imports for `LocaleResolver` and `LocaleResolverContext` are retained, but you must ensure those classes are available in the new dependency version you are using. If the package structure has changed, you may need to update those imports accordingly.
- No changes were made to method signatures or existing code, adhering to the guidelines provided. 
- The `@Override` annotation is retained because `resolveLocale` is still overriding the method from `LocaleResolver`. If the method signature does not exist in the newer version, consider removing it.
- The class is complete and should compile correctly if the necessary dependencies are included in your project.
