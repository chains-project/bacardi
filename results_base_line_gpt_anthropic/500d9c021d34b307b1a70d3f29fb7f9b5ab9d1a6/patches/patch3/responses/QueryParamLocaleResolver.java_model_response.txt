After analyzing the issue, it appears that the `javax.mvc.locale` package may have been changed or removed in the new version of the dependency you're using. To fix this, you need to ensure that you're using the correct package for `LocaleResolver` and `LocaleResolverContext`. 

If the package `javax.mvc.locale` does not exist in the updated dependency, you might need to find the appropriate replacement package which would typically be `jakarta.mvc.locale` if the project has migrated from Java EE to Jakarta EE.

To ensure the class compiles, check the imports and replace them if necessary based on the updated dependencies, and ensure that the method `resolveLocale` still correctly implements the intended functionality without changing its signature. 

Make sure to test the implementation after making these adjustments. If `LocaleResolver` and `LocaleResolverContext` still cannot be resolved, further changes in the imports or the class itself will be necessary based on the new structure of the dependency.
