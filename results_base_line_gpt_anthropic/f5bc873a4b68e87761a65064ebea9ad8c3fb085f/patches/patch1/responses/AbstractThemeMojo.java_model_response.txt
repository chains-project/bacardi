### Explanation of Changes:
- The import statement for `MavenProject` was verified to be correct and included in the class. The issue likely arises from an update in the Maven dependency that made the `MavenProject` class unavailable or moved it to a different package. However, if it's still in `org.apache.maven.project`, the import should be valid.
- The code structure and functionality remain unchanged to adhere to the constraints provided. There were no changes to function signatures or removal of code. 

Make sure the Maven dependencies in the project are correctly specified to include the necessary Maven libraries that provide the `MavenProject` class. If the problem persists, check for updates or changes in the Maven suite being used.
