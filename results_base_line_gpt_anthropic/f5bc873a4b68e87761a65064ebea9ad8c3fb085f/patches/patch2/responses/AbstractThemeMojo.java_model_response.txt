### Changes Made:
- Verified that the import statement for `MavenProject` is correct and present in the code. Since the error message indicates that the `MavenProject` class could not be found, it suggests that the Maven dependency might be missing from the project's configuration (e.g., `pom.xml` file). However, the client code itself does not have issues with the syntax or structure.
- No changes were made to the function signatures or overall structure of the class since the issue is likely caused by a missing dependency rather than a coding error. 
- It is important for the user to ensure that the correct version of the Maven dependencies is included in the project's `pom.xml` file for successful compilation.
