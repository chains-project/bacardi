### Analysis and Changes Made:
1. The error messages indicated that the packages `ClassLoadingStrategy` and `ClassInjector` could not be found. This typically suggests that the dependencies related to ByteBuddy may have been updated or removed from the project.
2. The code references classes from the `org.assertj.core.internal.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading` package. If the version of AssertJ or ByteBuddy being used has changed, the corresponding classes may have been relocated or renamed.
3. The code structure remains intact, and no method signatures have been altered as per the instructions. As the error is primarily due to missing dependencies, it's necessary to ensure that the correct versions of AssertJ and ByteBuddy are included in the project.
4. Ensure the `pom.xml` or build file is updated to include the correct versions of these libraries that contain the required classes. 

Please make sure to add the necessary dependencies in the build configuration to resolve the missing packages.
