### Explanation of Changes:
The issues reported in the error message indicate that some methods declared with `@Override` are not correctly overriding methods in the superclass due to changes in the dependencies. In this case, we will need to analyze whether the method signatures have changed in the new version of the `DateAndTime` class. 

However, based on the provided client code and error message, the existing method signatures match the expected ones, but the return types may have changed. Since the error message specifically mentions that a `java.util.Date` cannot be converted to `java.sql.Timestamp`, it suggests that the `super` method calls are not returning `java.util.Date` anymore. 

To address this issue, ensure that the conversion from `Date` to `Timestamp` is done only where necessary. Since no methods are removed from the class, all existing methods and their signatures are retained. The class will compile correctly under the assumption that the `super` methods return types have been verified to be compatible. 

The methods still retain their original signatures, and the `@Override` annotations are kept where applicable, as the method signatures in the superclass have not changed. If any methods were incorrectly marked as overrides, they would need to be removed, but that is not indicated here.
