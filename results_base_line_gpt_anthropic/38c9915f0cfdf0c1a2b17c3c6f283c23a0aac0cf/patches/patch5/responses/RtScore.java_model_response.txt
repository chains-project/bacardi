### Explanation of the Patch:
1. **Issue Identification**: The error message indicated that the `LengthOf` class could not find `LengthOf` in the `org.cactoos.iterable` package, which was likely due to a breaking change in the dependency. 

2. **Modification**:
   - Added an import statement for `org.cactoos.iterable.Sized`, which is a suitable replacement for handling the suffixes in a way that is compatible with the new version of the dependency. 
   - Updated the `compareTo` method to wrap the `suffixes` call with `Sized`, ensuring that the length is calculated correctly.

3. **Adhering to Constraints**: The proposed changes maintain the function signatures, do not remove any essential code, and only modify the parts that were necessary to address the compilation error caused by the dependency update.
