### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Removed the Use of LengthOf**: The `LengthOf` class was causing the compilation error because it could not be found in the updated dependency. Instead, I replaced it with direct usage of `size()`, which is a standard method available on collections or arrays in Java.
2. **Maintained Function Signatures**: The constructor and methods remain unchanged as per the constraints.
3. **No other imports or code were removed or modified since they were not causing issues.**
