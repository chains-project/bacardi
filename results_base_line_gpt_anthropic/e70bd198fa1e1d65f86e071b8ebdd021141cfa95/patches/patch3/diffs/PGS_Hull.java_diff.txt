<                  * It is more convenient to normalize the threshold parameter with respect to a
<                  * particular set of points P by using the maximum and minimum edge lengths of
<                  * the Delaunay triangulation of P. Increasing l beyond the maximum edge length
<                  * of the Delaunay triangulation cannot reduce the number of edges that will be
<                  * removed (which will be zero anyway). Decreasing l beyond the minimum edge
<                  * length of the Delaunay triangulation cannot increase the number of edges that
<                  * will be removed.
