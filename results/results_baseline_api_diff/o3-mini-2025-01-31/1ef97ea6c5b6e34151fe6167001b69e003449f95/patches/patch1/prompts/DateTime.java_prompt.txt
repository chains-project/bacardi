 Act as an Automatic Program Repair (APR) tool, reply only with code, without explanation.
You are specialized in breaking dependency updates, in which the failure is caused by an external dependency.
To solve the failure you can only work on the client code.
 the following client code fails:

```java
package com.github.knaufk.flink.faker;

import java.sql.Timestamp;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import net.datafaker.DateAndTime;
import net.datafaker.Faker;

public class DateTime extends DateAndTime {

  protected DateTime(Faker faker) {
    super(faker);
  }

  public Timestamp past(int atMost, TimeUnit unit) {
    return new Timestamp(super.past(atMost, unit).getTime());
  }

  public Timestamp past(int atMost, int minimum, TimeUnit unit) {
    return new Timestamp(super.past(atMost, minimum, unit).getTime());
  }

  @Override
  public Timestamp future(int atMost, TimeUnit unit) {
    return new Timestamp(super.future(atMost, unit).getTime());
  }

  @Override
  public Timestamp future(int atMost, int minimum, TimeUnit unit) {
    return new Timestamp(super.future(atMost, minimum, unit).getTime());
  }

  @Override
  public Timestamp future(int atMost, TimeUnit unit, Date referenceDate) {
    return new Timestamp(super.future(atMost, unit, referenceDate).getTime());
  }

  @Override
  public Timestamp past(int atMost, TimeUnit unit, Date referenceDate) {
    return new Timestamp(super.past(atMost, unit, referenceDate).getTime());
  }

  @Override
  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
  }

  @Override
  public Timestamp birthday() {
    return new Timestamp(super.birthday().getTime());
  }

  @Override
  public Timestamp birthday(int minAge, int maxAge) {
    return new Timestamp(super.birthday(minAge, maxAge).getTime());
  }
}

```

 with the following error information:
[ERROR] /flink-faker/src/main/java/com/github/knaufk/flink/faker/DateTime.java:[45,40] incompatible types: java.util.Date cannot be converted to java.sql.Timestamp

[ERROR] /flink-faker/src/main/java/com/github/knaufk/flink/faker/DateTime.java:[43,3] method does not override or implement a method from a supertype


The error is caused by a change in the API of the dependency. The new library version includes the following changes:
     Method net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(java.util.Date,java.util.Date,java.lang.String) has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
     Method net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(java.sql.Timestamp,java.sql.Timestamp) has been added in the new version of the dependency.
     Method net.datafaker.Time.between(java.time.LocalTime,java.time.LocalTime,java.lang.String) has been added in the new version of the dependency.
     Method net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(java.util.Date,java.util.Date) has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
     Method net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(java.sql.Timestamp,java.sql.Timestamp,java.lang.String) has been added in the new version of the dependency.
     Method net.datafaker.Time.between(java.time.LocalTime,java.time.LocalTime) has been added in the new version of the dependency.




 propose a patch that can be applied to the code to fix the issue.
 Return only a complete and compilable class in a fenced code block.
 Do not remove any code that you don't want to update keep it in the code block. Do not use "// ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)" in your response.
 You CANNOT change the function signature of any method but may create variables if it simplifies the code.
 You CAN remove the @Oxverride annotation IF AND ONLY IF the method no longer overrides a method in the updated dependency version.
 If fixing the issue requires addressing missing imports, ensure the correct package or class is used in accordance with the newer dependency version.
 Avoid removing any existing code unless it directly causes a compilation or functionality error. Don't use the comment "// ... (rest of the class remains unchanged)".
 Return only the fixed class, ensuring it fully compiles and adheres to these constraints.
