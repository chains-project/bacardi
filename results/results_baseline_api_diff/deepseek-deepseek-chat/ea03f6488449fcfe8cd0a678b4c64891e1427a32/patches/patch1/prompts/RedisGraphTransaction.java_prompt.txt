 Act as an Automatic Program Repair (APR) tool, reply only with code, without explanation.
You are specialized in breaking dependency updates, in which the failure is caused by an external dependency.
To solve the failure you can only work on the client code.

The error is caused by a change in the API of the dependency. The new library version includes the following changes:
     Class redis.clients.jedis.commands.BinaryScriptingCommandsPipeline has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
     Class redis.clients.jedis.commands.BinaryRedisPipeline has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
     Class redis.clients.jedis.commands.MultiKeyBinaryRedisPipeline has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
     Class redis.clients.jedis.commands.MultiKeyCommandsPipeline has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
     Class redis.clients.jedis.commands.ScriptingCommandsPipeline has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
     Type reference redis.clients.jedis.ClusterPipeline(java.util.Set,redis.clients.jedis.JedisClientConfig,org.apache.commons.pool2.impl.GenericObjectPoolConfig) has been added in the new version of the dependency.
     Interface redis.clients.jedis.ClusterPipeline has been added in the new version of the dependency.
     Type reference redis.clients.jedis.ClusterPipeline(redis.clients.jedis.providers.ClusterConnectionProvider) has been added in the new version of the dependency.
     Class redis.clients.jedis.commands.ClusterPipeline has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
     Type reference redis.clients.jedis.ClusterPipeline(java.util.Set,redis.clients.jedis.JedisClientConfig) has been added in the new version of the dependency.
     Class redis.clients.jedis.commands.RedisPipeline has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
     Class redis.clients.jedis.commands.BasicRedisPipeline has been removed in the new version of the dependency.




 propose a patch that can be applied to the code to fix the issue.
 Return only a complete and compilable class in a fenced code block.
 Do not remove any code that you don't want to update keep it in the code block. Do not use "// ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)" in your response.
 You CANNOT change the function signature of any method but may create variables if it simplifies the code.
 You CAN remove the @Oxverride annotation IF AND ONLY IF the method no longer overrides a method in the updated dependency version.
 If fixing the issue requires addressing missing imports, ensure the correct package or class is used in accordance with the newer dependency version.
 Avoid removing any existing code unless it directly causes a compilation or functionality error. Don't use the comment "// ... (rest of the class remains unchanged)".
 Return only the fixed class, ensuring it fully compiles and adheres to these constraints.
