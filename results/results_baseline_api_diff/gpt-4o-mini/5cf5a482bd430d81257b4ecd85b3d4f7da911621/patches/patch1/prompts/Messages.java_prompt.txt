 Act as an Automatic Program Repair (APR) tool, reply only with code, without explanation.
You are specialized in breaking dependency updates, in which the failure is caused by an external dependency.
To solve the failure you can only work on the client code.
 the following client code fails:

```java

import java.util.ResourceBundle;
import javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.inject.Named;
import javax.mvc.MvcContext;
//https://www.mvc-spec.org/learn/cookbook/multilang_en.html
/**
 * Provides I18n messages for the UI per request. To get the correct locale, the method {@link MvcContext#getLocale()}
 * is used. This method uses the built-in {@link javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver} of the used MVC Implementation.

 * @author Tobias Erdle
 * @see MvcContext#getLocale()

 */
@RequestScoped
@Named("msg")
public class Messages {

    private static final String BASE_NAME = "messages";

    @Inject
    private MvcContext mvcContext;

    /**
     * Get the assigned message to some key based on the {@link java.util.Locale} of the current request.
     *
     * @param key the message key to use
     * @return the correct translation assigned to the key for the request locale, a fallback translation or a

    public final String get(final String key) {
        final ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle(BASE_NAME, mvcContext.getLocale());

        return bundle.containsKey(key) ? bundle.getString(key) : formatUnknownKey(key);
    }

    private static String formatUnknownKey(final String key) {
        return String.format("???%s???", key);
    }
}

```

 with the following error information:
[ERROR] /jakartaee-mvc-sample/src/main/java/com/example/web/Messages.java:[23,13] cannot find symbol
  symbol:   class MvcContext
  location: class Messages


The error is caused by a change in the API of the dependency. The new library version includes the following changes:
     Class javax.mvc.MvcContext has been removed in the new version of the dependency.




 propose a patch that can be applied to the code to fix the issue.
 Return only a complete and compilable class in a fenced code block.
 Do not remove any code that you don't want to update keep it in the code block. Do not use "// ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)" in your response.
 You CANNOT change the function signature of any method but may create variables if it simplifies the code.
 You CAN remove the @Oxverride annotation IF AND ONLY IF the method no longer overrides a method in the updated dependency version.
 If fixing the issue requires addressing missing imports, ensure the correct package or class is used in accordance with the newer dependency version.
 Avoid removing any existing code unless it directly causes a compilation or functionality error. Don't use the comment "// ... (rest of the class remains unchanged)".
 Return only the fixed class, ensuring it fully compiles and adheres to these constraints.
