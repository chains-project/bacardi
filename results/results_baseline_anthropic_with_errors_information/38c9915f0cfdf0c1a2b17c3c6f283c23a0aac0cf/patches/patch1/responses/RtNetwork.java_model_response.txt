### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Dependency Update**: The error message indicates that `IoCheckedScalar` cannot be found in the `org.cactoos.scalar` package. This suggests that the class has been renamed or removed in the updated version of the library.
2. **Replacement**: The class `IoCheckedScalar` has been replaced with `IoChecked`, which serves a similar purpose in the newer version of the library.
3. **Code Integrity**: The function signatures and overall structure of the class remain unchanged, adhering to the constraints provided. The `@Override` annotations are retained as the methods still override the corresponding methods in the `Network` interface.
