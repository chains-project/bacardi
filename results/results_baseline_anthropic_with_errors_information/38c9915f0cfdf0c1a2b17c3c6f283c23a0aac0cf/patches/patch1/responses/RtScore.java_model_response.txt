1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `LengthOf` cannot be found in the package `org.cactoos.iterable`.
   - The error occurs at line 27, which is where `LengthOf` is being instantiated.
   - This suggests that the `LengthOf` class may have been removed or relocated in the updated version of the `org.cactoos` library.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic area is the use of `LengthOf` to calculate the length of the suffixes.
   - The `compareTo` method relies on this length calculation, which is critical for the functionality of the `RtScore` class.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Since `LengthOf` is not found, we need to find an alternative way to calculate the length of the `Iterable<Text>`.
   - We can use Java's built-in functionality to convert the `Iterable` to a collection and then get its size.
   - We will ensure that the method signatures remain unchanged and that we do not remove any existing code unless necessary.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Replace the `LengthOf` instantiation with a method to calculate the size of the `Iterable`.
   - This will involve converting the `Iterable<Text>` to a `Collection<Text>` or using a loop to count the elements.
   - Ensure that the changes do not affect the overall functionality of the class.
