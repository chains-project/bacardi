In this case, the error message indicates that the `CommandSource` class cannot be found, which suggests that the import statement for `CommandSource` may be incorrect or that the dependency has changed in a way that affects its availability. However, since the provided code already includes the correct import for `CommandSource`, no changes were necessary in the code itself. 

If the dependency update has indeed changed the package structure or the class name, you would need to check the updated documentation for the correct import path. If `CommandSource` has been moved to a different package or renamed, you would need to update the import statement accordingly. 

In this case, since the provided code is already correct, no modifications were made to the class. If the issue persists, further investigation into the dependency version and its documentation would be necessary.
