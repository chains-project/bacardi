 Act as an Automatic Program Repair (APR) tool, reply only with code, without explanation.
You are specialized in breaking dependency updates, in which the failure is caused by an external dependency.
To solve the failure you can only work on the client code.
 the following client code fails:
```java
package io.github.hapjava.server.impl.crypto;

import java.io.IOException;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.engines.ChaChaEngine;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.generators.Poly1305KeyGenerator;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.params.KeyParameter;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.params.ParametersWithIV;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;
import org.bouncycastle.util.Arrays;

public class ChachaDecoder {

  private final ChaChaEngine decryptCipher;

  public ChachaDecoder(byte[] key, byte[] nonce) throws IOException {

    this.decryptCipher = new ChaChaEngine(20);

    this.decryptCipher.init(false, new ParametersWithIV(new KeyParameter(key), nonce));
  }

  public byte[] decodeCiphertext(byte[] receivedMAC, byte[] additionalData, byte[] ciphertext)
      throws IOException {

    KeyParameter macKey = initRecordMAC(decryptCipher);

    byte[] calculatedMAC = PolyKeyCreator.create(macKey, additionalData, ciphertext);

    if (!Arrays.constantTimeAreEqual(calculatedMAC, receivedMAC)) {
      throw new TlsFatalAlert(AlertDescription.bad_record_mac);
    }

    byte[] output = new byte[ciphertext.length];
    decryptCipher.processBytes(ciphertext, 0, ciphertext.length, output, 0);

    return output;
  }

  public byte[] decodeCiphertext(byte[] receivedMAC, byte[] ciphertext) throws IOException {
    return decodeCiphertext(receivedMAC, null, ciphertext);
  }

  private KeyParameter initRecordMAC(ChaChaEngine cipher) {
    byte[] firstBlock = new byte[64];
    cipher.processBytes(firstBlock, 0, firstBlock.length, firstBlock, 0);

    // NOTE: The BC implementation puts 'r' after 'k'
    System.arraycopy(firstBlock, 0, firstBlock, 32, 16);
    KeyParameter macKey = new KeyParameter(firstBlock, 16, 32);
    Poly1305KeyGenerator.clamp(macKey.getKey());
    return macKey;
  }
}

```
the error is triggered in the following specific lines in the previous code:

```java
throw new TlsFatalAlert(AlertDescription.bad_record_mac);
```
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;
```
```java
throw new TlsFatalAlert(AlertDescription.bad_record_mac);
```
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;
```
```java
throw new TlsFatalAlert(AlertDescription.bad_record_mac);
```



 with the following error information:
[ERROR] /HAP-Java/src/main/java/io/github/hapjava/server/impl/crypto/ChachaDecoder.java:[31,17] cannot find symbol
  symbol:   class TlsFatalAlert
  location: class io.github.hapjava.server.impl.crypto.ChachaDecoder

[ERROR] /HAP-Java/src/main/java/io/github/hapjava/server/impl/crypto/ChachaDecoder.java:[8,35] package org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls does not exist

[ERROR] /HAP-Java/src/main/java/io/github/hapjava/server/impl/crypto/ChachaDecoder.java:[9,35] package org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls does not exist


The error is caused by a change in the API of the dependency. The new library version includes the following changes:
     Class org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
     Constructor org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert(short) has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
     Class org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
     Constructor org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription() has been removed in the new version of the dependency.




 propose a patch that can be applied to the code to fix the issue.
 Return only a complete and compilable class in a fenced code block.
 Do not remove any code that you don't want to update keep it in the code block. Do not use "// ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)" in your response.
 You CANNOT change the function signature of any method but may create variables if it simplifies the code.
 You CAN remove the @Oxverride annotation IF AND ONLY IF the method no longer overrides a method in the updated dependency version.
 If fixing the issue requires addressing missing imports, ensure the correct package or class is used in accordance with the newer dependency version.
 Avoid removing any existing code unless it directly causes a compilation or functionality error. Don't use the comment "// ... (rest of the class remains unchanged)".
 Return only the fixed class, ensuring it fully compiles and adheres to these constraints.
