the error is triggered in the following specific lines in the previous code:

```java
import org.cactoos.collection.CollectionOf;
```



 with the following error information:
[ERROR] /java-api/src/main/java/io/zold/api/Copies.java:[30,30] cannot find symbol
  symbol:   class CollectionOf
  location: package org.cactoos.collection


The error is caused by a change in the API of the dependency. The new library version includes the following changes:
     Constructor org.cactoos.collection.CollectionOf(java.lang.Iterable) has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
     Class org.cactoos.collection.CollectionOf has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
     Constructor org.cactoos.collection.CollectionOf(java.util.Iterator) has been removed in the new version of the dependency.
     Constructor org.cactoos.collection.CollectionOf(java.lang.Object[]) has been removed in the new version of the dependency.




 propose a patch that can be applied to the code to fix the issue.
 Return only a complete and compilable class in a fenced code block.
 Do not remove any code that you don't want to update keep it in the code block. Do not use "// ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)" in your response.
 You CANNOT change the function signature of any method but may create variables if it simplifies the code.
 You CAN remove the @Oxverride annotation IF AND ONLY IF the method no longer overrides a method in the updated dependency version.
 If fixing the issue requires addressing missing imports, ensure the correct package or class is used in accordance with the newer dependency version.
 Avoid removing any existing code unless it directly causes a compilation or functionality error. Don't use the comment "// ... (rest of the class remains unchanged)".
 Return only the fixed class, ensuring it fully compiles and adheres to these constraints.
