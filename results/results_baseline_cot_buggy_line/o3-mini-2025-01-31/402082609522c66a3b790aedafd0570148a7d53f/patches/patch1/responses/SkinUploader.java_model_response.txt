1. Error Message Analysis:
   - The error states that the symbol CommandSource cannot be found in package org.spongepowered.api.command.
   - This indicates that a dependency update to the Sponge API has moved the CommandSource class from its previous package.
   - The error occurs in the import, field declaration, and constructor parameter.

2. Client Code Analysis:
   - The code imports CommandSource from "org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSource" and uses it in the class.
   - Due to the dependency update, CommandSource has likely been relocated to a new package.
   - In newer versions of the Sponge API, CommandSource is found under the package "org.spongepowered.api.command.source".

3. Proposed Fix:
   - Update the import statement to refer to the correct package "org.spongepowered.api.command.source.CommandSource".
   - No changes to function signatures or logic, ensuring that only the import line is modified.
   - Keeping @Override annotations as they are assumed to correctly override methods from the parent class in the updated dependency.

4. Side Effects:
   - This change ensures that the code compiles with the updated dependency.
   - No adverse side effects are expected as this is a straightforward package adjustment.

Below is the complete, fixed Java class:

```java
package com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.task;

import com.github.games647.changeskin.core.model.auth.Account;
import com.github.games647.changeskin.core.shared.task.SharedUploader;
import com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.ChangeSkinSponge;

import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

import org.spongepowered.api.command.source.CommandSource;
import org.spongepowered.api.scheduler.Task;

public class SkinUploader extends SharedUploader {

    private final ChangeSkinSponge plugin;
    private final CommandSource invoker;

    public SkinUploader(ChangeSkinSponge plugin, CommandSource invoker, Account owner, String url) {
        super(plugin.getCore(), owner, url);
        this.plugin = plugin;
        this.invoker = invoker;
    }

    @Override
    public void sendMessageInvoker(String key) {
        plugin.sendMessage(invoker, key);
    }

    @Override
    protected void scheduleChangeTask(String oldSkinUrl) {
        Runnable task = new SkinChanger(plugin, owner, url, oldSkinUrl, invoker);
        Task.builder().delay(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES).execute(task).async().submit(plugin);
    }
}
```
