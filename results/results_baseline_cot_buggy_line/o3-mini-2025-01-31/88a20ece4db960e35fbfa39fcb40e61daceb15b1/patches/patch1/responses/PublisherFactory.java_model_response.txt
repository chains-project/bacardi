1. The error message indicates that the symbol "PublishMetadata" cannot be found in the package "com.google.cloud.pubsublite". This suggests that in the updated dependency, the PublishMetadata class has been relocated (or possibly renamed) to a different package.
2. In the client code, the problematic areas are:
   - The import statement: "import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;"
   - The method signature: "Publisher<PublishMetadata> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params);"
3. A common fix when dependencies are updated is to update the import to point to the new location of the class. Given that we are already importing another class from "com.google.cloud.pubsublite.internal" (namely, Publisher), it is likely that PublishMetadata has been moved there.
4. To fix the issue while preserving function signatures and adhering to constraints, we should update the import of PublishMetadata to the correct package (com.google.cloud.pubsublite.internal.PublishMetadata). This resolves the symbol error and makes the code compile without modifying the method signature.

import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.internal.Publisher;
import java.util.Map;

interface PublisherFactory {

  Publisher<PublishMetadata> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params);
