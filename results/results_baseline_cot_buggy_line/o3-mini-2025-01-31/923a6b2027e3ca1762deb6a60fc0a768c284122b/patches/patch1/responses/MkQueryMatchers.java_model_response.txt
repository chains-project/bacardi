<code_analysis>
1. The error message indicates that the class "Matchers" in the "org.hamcrest" package is no longer available. That is, the static factory method call "Matchers.<URI>hasProperty(...)" used in the hasPath and hasQuery methods fails to compile.
2. In the client code, the methods hasPath and hasQuery call Matchers.<URI>hasProperty("rawPath", path) and Matchers.<URI>hasProperty("rawQuery", query) respectively. This usage used to be available in earlier versions of Hamcrest but has now been removed or relocated in the updated dependency.
3. To fix the issue without changing the public API (i.e. function signatures) one can replace the use of Matchers.hasProperty with a custom matcher that inspects the desired property of the URI. Since we need to check, e.g., that URI.getRawPath() (or getRawQuery()) matches the given matcher, we can define an inner matcher class (extending TypeSafeMatcher<URI>) that extracts the relevant property from the URI (via a method reference) and delegates to the provided Matcher<String>.
4. The patch below removes the dependency on "org.hamcrest.Matchers" and adds a private static inner class (UriPropertyMatcher) to handle matching the "rawPath" or "rawQuery" on a URI. This approach meets all the constraints (no signature changes, only client-code modifications, and no removal of code unless it causes compilation failures).
