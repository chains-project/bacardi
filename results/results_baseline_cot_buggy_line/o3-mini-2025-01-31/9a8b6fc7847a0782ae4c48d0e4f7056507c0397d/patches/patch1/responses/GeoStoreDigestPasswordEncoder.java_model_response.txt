1. Error Analysis:
   - The error indicates that the package and symbol "org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder" cannot be found. This suggests that a recent dependency update removed or relocated the PasswordEncoder class.
   - The errors occur at the instantiation of PasswordEncoder (line 44) and its import statement (line 24). The createStringEncoder() method expects an instance of PasswordEncoder.
   
2. Client Code Review:
   - The createStringEncoder() method uses the now-missing class by instantiating it and setting a password encryptor on it.
   - The functionality is to wrap a StrongPasswordEncryptor (from jasypt-util, which is still available) so that passwords are encrypted accordingly.
   
3. Proposed Fix:
   - Remove the failing import of "org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder".
   - Replace the missing dependency by creating an inner class with the same name and similar behavior. This inner class (named PasswordEncoder) will have:
       • A setter for a PasswordEncryptor.
       • Methods to encode a password and validate a password using that encryptor.
   - This change ensures the method signature in createStringEncoder() remains unchanged and the rest of the functionality is preserved.
   
4. Changes Summary:
   - Remove the import statement for org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder.
   - Add a public static inner class (PasswordEncoder) inside GeoStoreDigestPasswordEncoder that implements the needed methods.
   - Leave all other code unchanged so that functionality and method signatures remain as expected.
