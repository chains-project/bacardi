1. The error message indicates that several Jedis pipeline interfaces (RedisPipeline, MultiKeyBinaryRedisPipeline, ClusterPipeline, BasicRedisPipeline, BinaryRedisPipeline, ScriptingCommandsPipeline, MultiKeyCommandsPipeline, and BinaryScriptingCommandsPipeline) cannot be found in the updated dependency. This suggests that in the updated Jedis version these interfaces have been removed or relocated.
2. In the client code, the interface RedisGraphPipeline extends multiple pipeline-related interfaces and imports them from redis.clients.jedis.commands. These now missing interfaces cause the compilation failures.
3. To fix the issue while preserving the method signatures and functionality of RedisGraphPipeline, we can remove the broken dependency interfaces from the extends clause and eliminate their related import statements.
4. The patch involves:
   - Removing the import statements that reference the missing pipeline interfaces.
   - Updating the extends clause of RedisGraphPipeline to only extend Closeable (or any remaining valid types if needed).
   - Leaving all method declarations untouched to maintain the interfaceâ€™s API.
