<code_analysis>
1. Error Analysis:
   - The first error is caused by calling the superclass constructor with two parameters. The updated MINA dependency now only provides a constructor that accepts a single SSLContext argument. This causes a "cannot be applied" error.
   - The second error is due to the missing constant PEER_ADDRESS. In previous versions, SslFilter may have provided a PEER_ADDRESS constant, but in the updated dependency this constant is no longer available.

2. Client Code Review:
   - In the first constructor (SSLFilter(SSLContext sslContext, boolean autoStart)), the call "super(sslContext, autoStart)" needs to be replaced with "super(sslContext)" because the updated dependency constructor does not accept a boolean.
   - In the onPreAdd method, the reference to the undefined symbol PEER_ADDRESS must be replaced by defining a new constant (e.g., private static final String PEER_ADDRESS = "peerAddress") within the SSLFilter class.

3. Proposed Modifications:
   - Modify the two-argument constructor to call super(sslContext) and ignore the autoStart parameter.
   - Define a static constant PEER_ADDRESS (with an appropriate string value) to be used with session.setAttribute.
   - Other methods remain unchanged to preserve intended functionality.

4. Considerations:
   - The modifications respect the function signatures and only address the compilation errors caused by the breaking dependency update.
   - The potential loss of autoStart functionality is noted, but the code adheres to the updated dependency's allowed constructor parameters.
