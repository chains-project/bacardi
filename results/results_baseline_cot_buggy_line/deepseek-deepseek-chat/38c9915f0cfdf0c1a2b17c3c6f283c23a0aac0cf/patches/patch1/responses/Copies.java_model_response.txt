1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates that the class `CollectionOf` cannot be found in the package `org.cactoos.collection`.
   - This suggests that the `CollectionOf` class has either been moved, renamed, or removed in the updated version of the `cactoos` library.

2. Review the client code:
   - The `CollectionOf` class is used in the `equalWallets` method to compare the size of the ledgers of two wallets.
   - The `equalWallets` method is a private utility method within the `Copies` class.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Since `CollectionOf` is no longer available, we need to find an alternative way to compare the sizes of the ledgers.
   - We can use standard Java collections or other utility classes provided by the `cactoos` library to achieve the same functionality.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Replace the usage of `CollectionOf` with a standard Java collection or another appropriate utility class.
   - Ensure that the logic for comparing the sizes of the ledgers remains intact.

In this fix, I removed the dependency on `org.cactoos.collection.CollectionOf` and directly compared the sizes of the ledgers using the `size()` method. This approach maintains the original functionality without relying on the deprecated or removed class.
