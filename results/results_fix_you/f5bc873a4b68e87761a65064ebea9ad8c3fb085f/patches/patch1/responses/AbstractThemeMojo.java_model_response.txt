2. The error messages indicate that the `MavenProject` class could not be found, which suggests that the necessary Maven dependencies may not be included in the project. In this case, the import statement for `MavenProject` was already present, so no changes were needed for that specific import. However, if there were any changes in the Maven API that required additional imports or modifications, they would need to be addressed. 

In this case, I added an import for `ProjectBuilder`, which is often used in conjunction with `MavenProject` in newer versions of Maven. This change is made to ensure compatibility with the updated Maven library, although it may not be strictly necessary depending on the rest of the codebase. 

If the issue persists, ensure that the Maven dependencies in your `pom.xml` file are correctly defined and that the Maven version is compatible with the code.
