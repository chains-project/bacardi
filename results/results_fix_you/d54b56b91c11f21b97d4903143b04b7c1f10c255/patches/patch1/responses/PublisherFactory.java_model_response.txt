package com.google.pubsublite.kafka.sink;

import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PubsubMessage; // Updated import

import java.util.Map;

interface PublisherFactory {

  Publisher<PubsubMessage> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params); // Updated type
}
```

2. The changes made include:
   - Replaced the import of `PublishMetadata` with `PubsubMessage`, as `PublishMetadata` was removed or renamed in the updated version of the library.
   - Updated the generic type in the `Publisher` interface from `PublishMetadata` to `PubsubMessage` to reflect the new class that should be used for publishing messages in the updated library version. This maintains the functionality of the code while aligning it with the new library structure.
