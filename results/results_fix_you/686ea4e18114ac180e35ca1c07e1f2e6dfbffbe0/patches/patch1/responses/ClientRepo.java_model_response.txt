2. The error messages indicate that the `Client` class cannot be found in the `ClientRepo` class. This is likely due to changes in the `io.dropwizard` library between versions 2.1.5 and 4.0.0. In the updated version, the `Client` class may have been moved or replaced. 

To resolve this, I added an import statement for `javax.ws.rs.client.ClientBuilder`, which is commonly used to create instances of `Client`. However, since the original code does not instantiate `Client` directly, you may need to ensure that the `Client` being used is correctly imported from the appropriate package. 

If the `Client` class is still not found, you may need to check the documentation for `io.dropwizard` version 4.0.0 to see if there are any additional changes regarding the `Client` class or if it has been replaced with another class.
