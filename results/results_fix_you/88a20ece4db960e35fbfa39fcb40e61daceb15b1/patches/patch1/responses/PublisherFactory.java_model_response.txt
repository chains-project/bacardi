2. The changes made include updating the import statement from `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata` to `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PubSubMessage`, and changing the type parameter in the `Publisher` interface from `PublishMetadata` to `PubSubMessage`. This reflects the changes in the library from version 0.6.0 to 1.6.3, where `PublishMetadata` was likely replaced or renamed, and `PubSubMessage` is the new type used for publishing messages. These updates maintain the original functionality of the code while aligning it with the new library version.
