```java
package de.hilling.junit.cdi.scope;

import org.immutables.value.Value;

import jakarta.interceptor.InterceptorBinding; // Updated import from javax to jakarta
import java.lang.annotation.*;

/**
 * Marker interface used internally by the {@link de.hilling.junit.cdi.scope.TestScopeExtension} to
 * mark classes that can be mocked or replaced by other test beans.
 */
@Inherited
@InterceptorBinding
@Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.TYPE})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Value.Immutable
public @interface Replaceable {
}
```

2. The change made was to update the import statement for `InterceptorBinding` from `javax.interceptor.InterceptorBinding` to `jakarta.interceptor.InterceptorBinding`. This change reflects the package restructuring that occurred with the transition from the `javax` namespace to the `jakarta` namespace in the Jakarta EE specifications, which is necessary for compatibility with version 2.0.0 of the `jakarta.interceptor` library. No other changes were made to the code, ensuring that the functionality remains unchanged.
