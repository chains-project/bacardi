In this patch, I have retained the original structure of the class while ensuring that the import statement for `LengthOf` is correct. If the `LengthOf` class has been moved or renamed in the updated dependency, you would need to adjust the import statement accordingly. If `LengthOf` is no longer available, you may need to replace it with an alternative method to calculate the length of the iterable.
