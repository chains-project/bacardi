```java
package com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.command;

import org.spongepowered.api.command.spec.CommandSpec;
import org.spongepowered.api.command.spec.CommandSpec.Builder; // Importing the Builder class if needed

@FunctionalInterface
public interface ChangeSkinCommand {

    CommandSpec buildSpec();
}
``` 

In this patch, I ensured that the necessary imports are included, and I maintained the existing function signature and structure of the class. If the `CommandSpec` class has been moved or renamed in the updated dependency, you may need to adjust the import statement accordingly.
