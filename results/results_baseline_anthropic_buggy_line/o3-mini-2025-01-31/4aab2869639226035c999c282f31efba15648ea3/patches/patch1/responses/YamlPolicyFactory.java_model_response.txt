1. The error message shows that the class Storages cannot be found in the package com.artipie.asto.factory. This indicates that a dependency update has removed or relocated the Storages class.
2. In the client code the problematic lines are:
   - The import statement: “import com.artipie.asto.factory.Storages;”
   - The instantiation: “new Storages().newStorage(…)”
3. Given the dependency update, the Storages API appears to have been replaced by a new factory class. In the updated version the functionality is provided via a static method from a class we assume is named StorageFromConfig (in the same package) that creates a storage instance from the given type and configuration.
4. To fix the issue:
   - Remove the reference to Storages.
   - Replace it with a static call to StorageFromConfig.newStorage(…).
   - Update the import statement to import the correct class (StorageFromConfig).
5. This change adheres to the constraints: the method signature is unchanged; we only modify the instantiation of the storage based on the dependency update while preserving the existing logic.
