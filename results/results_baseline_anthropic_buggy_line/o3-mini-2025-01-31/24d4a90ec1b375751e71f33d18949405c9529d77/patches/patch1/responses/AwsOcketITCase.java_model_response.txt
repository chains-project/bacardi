1. The error message indicates that the class Tv cannot be found in the package com.jcabi.aspects. The error arises from the import:
   import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;
   and from its usage in the second test method.
   
2. In the client code, Tv is used to obtain two integer constants (Tv.HUNDRED and Tv.THOUSAND) that are multiplied together when generating a random string. With the dependency update, the Tv class has been removed from jcabi-aspects.

3. To fix this, we replace Tv.HUNDRED and Tv.THOUSAND with their literal values (100 and 1000), thereby removing the dependency on the missing Tv class without altering the test behavior.

4. The necessary changes are:
   - Remove the import for com.jcabi.aspects.Tv.
   - Replace Tv.HUNDRED * Tv.THOUSAND with 100 * 1000 in the RandomStringUtils.random() call.
