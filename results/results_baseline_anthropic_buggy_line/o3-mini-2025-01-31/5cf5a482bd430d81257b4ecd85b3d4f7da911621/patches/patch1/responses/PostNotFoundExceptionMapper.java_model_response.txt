1. Examine the error message:
   - The error indicates that the class Models cannot be found.
   - The failure occurs at the field declaration (line 29) in the PostNotFoundExceptionMapper.
   - This is likely due to an update in the dependency, where the Models interface has been moved from the javax.mvc package to a new namespace.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic code is the injection of Models via "@Inject Models models;".
   - The import statement "import javax.mvc.Models;" is causing the issue.
   - Given the updated dependency (e.g., Jakarta EE 9+), MVC classes have been moved to the jakarta.mvc package.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Update the import statement for Models to point to its new package.
   - Since we cannot change method signatures or remove code unnecessarily, we fix the code by simply replacing the old import with the appropriate new one.
   - The rest of the class (including the @Override annotation) remains untouched.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Remove "import javax.mvc.Models;".
   - Add "import jakarta.mvc.Models;" so that the dependency resolves correctly with the updated API.
   - Verify that changes adhere to the dependency update while keeping the class functionality intact.

Below is the complete fixed Java class:

```java
package com.example.config;

import com.example.domain.TaskNotFoundException;
import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.mvc.Models;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;
import javax.ws.rs.ext.ExceptionMapper;
import javax.ws.rs.ext.Provider;

@Provider
public class PostNotFoundExceptionMapper implements ExceptionMapper<TaskNotFoundException> {

    @Inject Logger log;
    @Inject Models models;

    @Override
    public Response toResponse(TaskNotFoundException exception) {
        log.log(Level.INFO, "handling exception : PostNotFoundException");
        models.put("error", exception.getMessage());
        return Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).entity("error.xhtml").build();
    }
}
```
