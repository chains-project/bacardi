1. The error message indicates that the compiler cannot locate the class CommandSource in the package org.spongepowered.api.command. This error is triggered on the import statement and the use of the CommandSource type for the field “invoker” as well as in the constructor.
2. Reviewing the client code shows that the “invoker” field and parameter is declared as CommandSource and used in calls to plugin.sendMessage(). This suggests that the Sponge API dependency was updated and the formerly available CommandSource is now either removed or replaced by another type.
3. In newer versions of Sponge (with the adoption of Adventure), command-related messaging is handled via the Audience interface from the Kyori Adventure library. As such, replacing CommandSource with Audience reflects the updated dependency.
4. The necessary modifications are:
   - Change the import from org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSource to net.kyori.adventure.audience.Audience.
   - Update the field declaration and constructor parameter types from CommandSource to Audience.
   - Ensure that the rest of the code (which calls plugin.sendMessage(invoker, id)) remains compatible with Audience.
These changes address the dependency update without altering the overriding methods or removing unnecessary code.
