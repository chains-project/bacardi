1. The error message indicates that the class LengthOf from the package org.cactoos.iterable cannot be found. This suggests that in a dependency update, the LengthOf class was either moved or removed.
2. The client code uses LengthOf within a lambda to compute the size (number of items) of an iterable returned by n.score().suffixes(). With the updated dependency, this class is no longer available.
3. To fix this issue while keeping the method signature unchanged, we can remove the import statement for LengthOf and replace its usage with a helper method that manually calculates the length of an iterable.
4. The patch involves:
   - Removing the import of org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf.
   - Adding a private static helper method (lengthOf) in the TaxBeneficiaries class that takes an Iterable and returns its count.
   - Replacing new LengthOf(...).intValue() with a call to this helper method.
