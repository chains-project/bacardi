1. The error message indicates that the class PublishMetadata cannot be found in the package com.google.cloud.pubsublite. This means that in the updated dependency the location of PublishMetadata has likely changed.
2. In the client code, PublishMetadata is imported from the now-incorrect package. The Publisher interface (from com.google.cloud.pubsublite.internal.Publisher) expects a valid PublishMetadata type.
3. To fix this issue, we need to update the import statement to reference the correct package location for PublishMetadata as defined in the new version of the dependency.
4. Assuming that the new dependency version relocates PublishMetadata to com.google.cloud.pubsublite.proto, the required change is to update the import from:
   import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;
   to:
   import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.proto.PublishMetadata;
5. This patch keeps the function signature and overall design intact while ensuring that the correct class is referenced.
