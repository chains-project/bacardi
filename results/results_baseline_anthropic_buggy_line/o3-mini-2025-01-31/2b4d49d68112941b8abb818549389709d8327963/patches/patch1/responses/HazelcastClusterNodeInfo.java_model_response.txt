1. Error Message Analysis:
   - The error indicates that the symbol "Member" cannot be found in the package com.hazelcast.core.
   - The error occurs at the constructor declaration and in the import statement.
   - This suggests that in the updated Hazelcast dependency, the Member interface has been moved to a different package.

2. Client Code Review:
   - The constructor of HazelcastClusterNodeInfo receives a Member parameter.
   - The import statement "import com.hazelcast.core.Member;" is now failing.
   - The code also uses methods like getStringAttribute and getSocketAddress, which in the new version are likely replaced with getAttribute and getAddress, respectively.

3. Potential Fix:
   - Update the import to use the new package: "com.hazelcast.cluster.Member".
   - Replace the call to member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE) with a call to member.getAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE) cast to String.
   - Replace member.getSocketAddress().getHostString() with member.getAddress().getHost(), which is compatible with the updated API.
   - All changes are made within the constructor; no function signatures or overall structure is altered.

4. Change Plan:
   - Change the import line.
   - Modify the constructor to use updated Hazelcast API methods.
   - Ensure that the changes compile with the updated Hazelcast dependency.
