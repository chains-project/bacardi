 Act as an Automatic Program Repair (APR) tool, reply only with code, without explanation.
You are specialized in breaking dependency updates, in which the failure is caused by an external dependency.
To solve the failure you can only work on the client code.
 the following client code fails:
```java
package com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.task;

import com.github.games647.changeskin.core.model.skin.SkinModel;
import com.github.games647.changeskin.core.shared.task.SharedDownloader;
import com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.ChangeSkinSponge;

import java.util.UUID;

import org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSource;
import org.spongepowered.api.entity.living.player.Player;
import org.spongepowered.api.scheduler.Task;

public class SkinDownloader extends SharedDownloader {

    private final ChangeSkinSponge plugin;
    private final CommandSource invoker;
    private final Player receiver;

    public SkinDownloader(ChangeSkinSponge plugin, CommandSource invoker, Player receiver, UUID targetUUID
            , boolean keepSkin) {
        super(plugin.getCore(), keepSkin, targetUUID, receiver.getUniqueId());

        this.plugin = plugin;
        this.invoker = invoker;
        this.receiver = receiver;
    }

    @Override
    protected void scheduleApplyTask(SkinModel skinData) {
        Runnable skinUpdater = new SkinApplier(plugin, invoker, receiver, skinData, keepSkin);
        Task.builder().execute(skinUpdater).submit(plugin);
    }

    @Override
    public void sendMessageInvoker(String id) {
        plugin.sendMessage(invoker, id);
    }
}

```
the error is triggered in the following specific lines in the previous code:

```java
private final CommandSource invoker;
```
```java
public SkinDownloader(ChangeSkinSponge plugin, CommandSource invoker, Player receiver, UUID targetUUID
```
```java
import org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSource;
```

 propose a patch that can be applied to the code to fix the issue.
 Return only a complete and compilable class in a fenced code block.
 Do not remove any code that you don't want to update keep it in the code block. Do not use "// ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)" in your response.
 You CANNOT change the function signature of any method but may create variables if it simplifies the code.
 You CAN remove the @Override annotation IF AND ONLY IF the method no longer overrides a method in the updated dependency version.
 If fixing the issue requires addressing missing imports, ensure the correct package or class is used in accordance with the newer dependency version.
 Avoid removing any existing code unless it directly causes a compilation or functionality error. Don't use the comment "// ... (rest of the class remains unchanged)".
 Return only the fixed class, ensuring it fully compiles and adheres to these constraints.
