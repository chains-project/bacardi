<          * Calculate the distance between two points in 3D space, where each point
<          * represents a circle with (x, y, r) coordinates. This custom metric considers
<          * both the Euclidean distance between the centers of the circles and the
<          * absolute difference of their radii.
<          * <p>
<          * The metric is defined as follows: Given two points A and B, representing
<          * circles centered at (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) with radii r1 and r2 respectively,
<          * the distance is calculated as sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) + |r1 - r2|.
<          * <p>
<          * This metric can be used to find the nearest circle to a given center (x, y)
<          * in a proximity search. To perform the search, use a point (x, y, R) where R
<          * is greater than or equal to the maximum radius of a circle in the proximity
<          * structure.

<          * @return the distance between the two points based on the custom metric
