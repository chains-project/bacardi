1. Examine the error message:
   - The compiler complains that the symbol "Tv" is not found. In particular, it cannot resolve the variable Tv on line 77 and the class Tv (imported from com.jcabi.aspects) on line 33.
   - This indicates that the newer version of the dependency no longer provides the Tv class, and therefore the Tv fields (SEVEN, TEN, MILLION) are missing.

2. Review the client code:
   - The class SshByPassword uses Tv.SEVEN in the @RetryOnFailure annotation.
   - It also uses Tv.TEN for the server alive interval and Tv.MILLION for the server alive count.
   - These usages are now causing compilation errors due to the breaking dependency update.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Since the Tv class is no longer available, the simplest solution is to replace its constants with their literal values.
   - We assume that Tv.SEVEN is 7, Tv.TEN is 10, and Tv.MILLION is 1000000.
   - No other modifications are needed, as we should not change any function signatures or remove annotations unless necessary.

4. Plan the necessary changes:
   - Remove the import of Tv (com.jcabi.aspects.Tv).
   - Replace Tv.SEVEN with 7 in the @RetryOnFailure annotation.
   - Replace Tv.TEN with 10 when converting seconds to milliseconds for the server alive interval.
   - Replace Tv.MILLION with 1000000 when setting the server alive count max.
   - These changes directly address the missing symbols while retaining the original intent of the code.
