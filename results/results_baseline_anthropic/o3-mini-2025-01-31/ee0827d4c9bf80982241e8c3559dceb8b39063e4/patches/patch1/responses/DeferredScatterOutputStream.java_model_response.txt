<code_analysis>
1. The error message indicates that the method call dfos.write(byte[], int, int) within the writeOut method cannot be found on the OffloadingOutputStream instance. This suggests that a recent dependency update removed or changed the method signature.
2. In the client code, the writeOut method calls dfos.write(data, offset, length), which previously compiled because OffloadingOutputStream provided such a method. With the dependency update, OffloadingOutputStream likely now only supports writing data one byte at a time (via write(int)).
3. To fix the issue without altering function signatures, we can replace the call to dfos.write(data, offset, length) with code that iterates over the specified portion of the byte array and writes each byte individually using write(int).
4. This change is localized only to the writeOut method and does not alter any public interfaces or method signatures.
