1. The error message indicates that the PublishMetadata class cannot be found in the package com.google.cloud.pubsublite. This suggests that with the dependency update, PublishMetadata has either been moved or removed from its previous package.
2. In the client code, the problematic import is:
   import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;
   This import is used in the PublisherFactory interface to parameterize the Publisher.
3. To fix the issue without modifying any function signatures, the solution is to update the import to reference the correct package for PublishMetadata. Given that Publisher is imported from com.google.cloud.pubsublite.internal.Publisher, the PublishMetadata class is now located in com.google.cloud.pubsublite.internal.
4. The change involves updating the import statement so that the correct PublishMetadata class is used. This change directly addresses the missing symbol error while preserving the interface signature and structure.
