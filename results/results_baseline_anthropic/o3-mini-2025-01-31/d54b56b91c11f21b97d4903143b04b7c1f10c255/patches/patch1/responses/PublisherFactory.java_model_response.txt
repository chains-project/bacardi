1. The error message indicates that the class PublishMetadata cannot be found in package com.google.cloud.pubsublite. This means that in the updated dependency version the class has likely been moved to a different package.
2. In the client code, PublishMetadata is imported from com.google.cloud.pubsublite, but the updated dependency now provides it in a different location. Notice that the Publisher is still imported from com.google.cloud.pubsublite.internal, so it makes sense that PublishMetadata was also moved into the internal package.
3. To fix the issue we only need to update the import statement to refer to com.google.cloud.pubsublite.internal.PublishMetadata, ensuring that the rest of the code (including the method signature) remains unchanged.
4. In summary, the patch replaces the problematic import:
   • From: import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.PublishMetadata;
   • To:   import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.internal.PublishMetadata;
This change resolves the symbol not found error and aligns the client code with the updated dependency's package structure.
