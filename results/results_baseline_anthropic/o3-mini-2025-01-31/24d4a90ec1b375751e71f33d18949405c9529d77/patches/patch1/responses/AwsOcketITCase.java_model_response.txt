1. The error message indicates that the symbol Tv (specifically Tv.HUNDRED and Tv.THOUSAND) cannot be found in the package com.jcabi.aspects. This means that after updating the dependency, the Tv class (or its fields) is no longer available.
2. In the client code, the failure occurs in the readsAndWritesLargeObjectContent() test:
     final String data = RandomStringUtils.random(Tv.HUNDRED * Tv.THOUSAND);
   Since Tv is missing, the compilation fails.
3. To fix this issue, we can replace the dependency on Tv with its literal equivalent. Since Tv.HUNDRED and Tv.THOUSAND represent 100 and 1000 respectively, we can replace Tv.HUNDRED * Tv.THOUSAND with 100 * 1000.
4. The patch will:
   - Remove the import for com.jcabi.aspects.Tv.
   - Substitute the constant expression using numeric literals to maintain the intended logic.
