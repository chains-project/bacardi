1. Error Message Analysis:
   - The error indicates that the class LengthOf cannot be found in the package org.cactoos.iterable.
   - This is occurring on the lines within the compareTo method where new LengthOf(...) is used.
   - The dependency update in cactoos has moved (or removed) LengthOf from org.cactoos.iterable.

2. Client Code Review:
   - The problematic lines are:
         return new LengthOf(other.suffixes()).intValue()
             - new LengthOf(this.sfxs).intValue();
   - The import statement currently attempts to import LengthOf from org.cactoos.iterable.

3. Potential Fix Considerations:
   - In the updated version of cactoos, the LengthOf class has been relocated to org.cactoos.scalar.
   - Therefore, the fix is to update the import to refer to org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf.
   - There is no need to change the method signatures or logic.
   - This approach directly addresses the missing symbol error without impacting functionality.

4. Specific Modifications:
   - Change the import line from:
         import org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf;
     to:
         import org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf;
   - No other changes to the code logic or annotations are necessary.
