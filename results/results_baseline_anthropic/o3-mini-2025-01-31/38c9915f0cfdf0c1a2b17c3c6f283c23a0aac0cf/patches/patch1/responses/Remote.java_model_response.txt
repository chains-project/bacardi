1. The error message indicates that the class RandomText from the package org.cactoos.text cannot be found. In the Fake(int) constructor (line 28), the code calls new RandomText(), which now causes a compilation error due to a breaking dependency update.
2. In the client code, the problematic part is in the Fake constructor where a new instance of RandomText is passed into the Repeated constructor. With the updated dependency, RandomText was removed or renamed.
3. To fix this issue without changing any function signatures, we can replace the missing RandomText with an equivalent implementation. Since RandomText was used to generate a text value (presumably random), we can create our own small internal implementation of the Text interface that produces a random value (using, for example, java.util.UUID).
4. The patch involves:
   - Removing the import for org.cactoos.text.RandomText.
   - Importing java.util.UUID (and org.cactoos.Text if needed).
   - Defining an internal replacement class (RandomText) inside Remote.Fake so that new RandomText() resolves to this new implementation.
   - The new class implements org.cactoos.Text with an asString() method that returns a random string.
This patch should resolve the compilation error caused by the broken dependency update.
