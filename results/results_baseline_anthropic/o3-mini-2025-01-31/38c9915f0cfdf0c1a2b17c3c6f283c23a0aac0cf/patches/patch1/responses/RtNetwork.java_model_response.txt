1. Error Message Examination:
   - The error states that the class IoCheckedScalar cannot be found in the package org.cactoos.scalar.
   - This suggests that after a dependency update (in the cactoos library), the IoCheckedScalar class was either removed or renamed.
   - The error points to line 30 where IoCheckedScalar is being instantiated.

2. Client Code Review:
   - The problematic line is in the pull() method where IoCheckedScalar is used to wrap a Reduced scalar.
   - The import statement for IoCheckedScalar is now invalid given the dependency update.

3. Potential Fix:
   - In the newer version of the cactoos library, IoCheckedScalar has been replaced with IoChecked.
   - Update the import from org.cactoos.scalar.IoCheckedScalar to org.cactoos.scalar.IoChecked.
   - Replace the instantiation of IoCheckedScalar with IoChecked while leaving the rest of the code unchanged.

4. Planned Changes:
   - Replace the line importing IoCheckedScalar with an import for IoChecked.
   - Update the pull() method by replacing “new IoCheckedScalar<>( … )” with “new IoChecked<>( … )”.
   - All other code remains the same.
