<code_analysis>
1. Error Analysis:
   - The error message indicates that the class "Member" cannot be found in "com.hazelcast.core". This is because in the newer version of Hazelcast, the Member interface has been moved from the com.hazelcast.core package to the com.hazelcast.cluster package.
   - The error occurs where the Member type is used as a parameter in the constructor and as part of the field declarations.

2. Client Code Review:
   - The code imports com.hazelcast.core.Member and uses it in the constructor:
       • member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE)
       • member.getSocketAddress().getHostString()
   - In the updated Hazelcast dependency:
       • The Member interface is now in com.hazelcast.cluster package.
       • The method getStringAttribute(String) is replaced by the generic getAttribute(String) method.
       • Instead of getSocketAddress(), the new API provides getAddress(), and the Address object exposes the host via getHost().

3. Fix Plan:
   - Modify the import to use com.hazelcast.cluster.Member.
   - Replace member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE) with (String) member.getAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE).
   - Replace member.getSocketAddress().getHostString() with member.getAddress().getHost().
   - These changes preserve the function signatures and logic while adapting to the updated dependency.

4. Side Effects:
   - This patch assumes that the new Hazelcast Member interface provides getAttribute(String) and getAddress() methods as described.
   - It preserves the overall functionality of building the hostname string.
