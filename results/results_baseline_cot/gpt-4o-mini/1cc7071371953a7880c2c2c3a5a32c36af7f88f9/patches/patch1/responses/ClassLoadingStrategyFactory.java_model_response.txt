**Changes made:**
- The original code was already using the correct imports and structure. The error messages indicated that the `ClassInjector` and `ClassLoadingStrategy` packages were not found, which suggests that the dependencies might not be included in the project. 
- Ensure that the correct version of the AssertJ and ByteBuddy libraries are included in your build configuration (e.g., Maven or Gradle) to resolve the missing packages. 
- No changes were made to the code itself since it was already correct and adhered to the guidelines provided.
