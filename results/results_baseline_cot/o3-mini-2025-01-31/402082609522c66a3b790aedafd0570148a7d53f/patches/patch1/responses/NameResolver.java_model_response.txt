1. Error Message Observations:
   • The error indicates that the compiler cannot find the class CommandSource in package org.spongepowered.api.command.
   • Specifically, the error is raised at lines where CommandSource is used (fields and constructor parameters).
   • This indicates that, following the dependency update, CommandSource has been moved or renamed.

2. Client Code Review:
   • The class imports CommandSource from org.spongepowered.api.command, which is now invalid.
   • CommandSource is used as a type for the "invoker" variable, passed to various methods.
   • No changes to function signatures are needed.

3. Potential Fix:
   • Update the import to match the new location of CommandSource.
   • In recent SpongeAPI updates, CommandSource has been relocated to org.spongepowered.api.command.source.CommandSource.
   • Replace the old import with the new import without altering the existing functionality.

4. Planned Changes:
   • Remove: import org.spongepowered.api.command.CommandSource;
   • Add: import org.spongepowered.api.command.source.CommandSource;
   • All other code remains intact as no method signature changes are required.
