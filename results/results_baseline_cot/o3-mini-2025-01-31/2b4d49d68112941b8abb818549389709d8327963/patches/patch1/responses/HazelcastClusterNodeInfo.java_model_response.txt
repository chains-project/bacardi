<code_analysis>
1. Issue Identification:
   - The error message indicates that the symbol "Member" cannot be found in the package "com.hazelcast.core". This suggests that a dependency update (from Hazelcast) has moved or renamed the Member class.
   - The error is reported on lines where "Member" is used, in the constructor parameter and its usage in the code (e.g., member.getStringAttribute and member.getSocketAddress).

2. Client Code Review:
   - The import statement "import com.hazelcast.core.Member;" is now invalid due to the update.
   - In the constructor of HazelcastClusterNodeInfo, the code calls member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE) and member.getSocketAddress().getHostString(). These methods may have been changed in the updated Hazelcast API.
   - In updated versions of Hazelcast, the Member interface has been moved to "com.hazelcast.cluster.Member". Additionally, methods like getStringAttribute and getSocketAddress() have changed. The new API provides getAttribute(String key) (which returns an Object) and getAddress() (which returns an Address that provides host information).

3. Proposed Fix:
   - Update the import to "com.hazelcast.cluster.Member".
   - Replace member.getStringAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE) with member.getAttribute(HOST_NAME_ATTRIBUTE) cast to a String (with a fallback if null).
   - Replace member.getSocketAddress().getHostString() with member.getAddress().getHost(), which is assumed to provide equivalent host string information.
   - All other code remains unchanged.

4. Side Effects:
   - The patch uses a fallback for the hostname attribute if it is not set.
   - It assumes the new Hazelcast APIâ€™s methods and classes are available and that ClusteredCacheFactory.getNodeID(member) accepts the new Member type.
