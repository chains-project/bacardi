1. Error Analysis:
   - The error message indicates that the class "LengthOf" cannot be found in the package "org.cactoos.iterable".
   - The issue originates from the client code at the line where "new LengthOf(n.score().suffixes()).intValue()" is invoked.
   - This suggests that a dependency update of the cactoos library has moved (or removed) the LengthOf class from "org.cactoos.iterable" to another package.

2. Client Code Review:
   - The code uses "LengthOf" to calculate the number of elements in the Iterable returned by "n.score().suffixes()".
   - The import currently used is "import org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf;", which now triggers the compiler error.
   - Other parts of the class remain unaffected by the dependency update.

3. Proposed Fix Strategy:
   - Update the import statement to use the new package where LengthOf now resides. According to the updated dependency, LengthOf is now within "org.cactoos.scalar".
   - This change preserves the functionality and adheres to the original function signatures.
   - No method signatures or core code logic are changed apart from the updated import.

4. Specific Modifications:
   - Remove the import of "org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf".
   - Add the correct import: "org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf".
   - Ensure that the rest of the code remains unchanged and compiles correctly with the updated dependency.
