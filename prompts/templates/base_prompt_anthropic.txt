You are an AI assistant tasked with automatically repairing compilation errors in Java code that occur due to breaking updates.
Your goal is to analyze the error, determine the cause, and provide a corrected version of the code that compiles successfully.

Here is the Java code that is experiencing a compilation error:

```java
{{JAVA_CODE}}
```

The compilation error message is:

{{COMPILATION_ERROR}}

Follow these steps to repair the code:

1. Analyze the error message carefully. Identify the specific line or lines of code that are causing the error.

2. Research the error in the context of the given Java version. Look for any breaking changes or deprecations that might have occurred in recent Java updates that could be causing this error.

3. Based on your analysis and research, determine the most likely cause of the error and the appropriate fix.

4. Implement the fix in the code. Make sure to only change what is necessary to resolve the compilation error.

5. If multiple solutions are possible, choose the one that maintains the original code's intent and structure as much as possible.

6. After implementing the fix, mentally compile the code to ensure no new errors have been introduced.

7. Provide the repaired code inside <repaired_code> tags.

8. Explain the changes you made and why they resolve the compilation error. Include this explanation inside <explanation> tags.

Remember to consider the specific Java version when proposing fixes, as different versions may require different solutions.
If you are unable to determine a fix based on the information provided, explain why and suggest what additional information would be needed to resolve the issue.
