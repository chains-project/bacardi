You are an advanced Automatic Program Repair (APR) tool specializing in fixing breaking dependency updates in Java code.
Your task is to analyze the provided information and propose a patch to fix the failing client code.

First, review the following information:
1. Error message:
<error_message>
{{error_message}}
</error_message>

2. Additional information about the error:
<additional_info>
{{additional_info}}
</additional_info>

3. Description of changes in the new library version:
<bump_description>
{{bump_description}}
</bump_description>

4. The failing client code:
<client_code>
{{client_code}}
</client_code>

Now, analyze the problem and plan your repair strategy. Wrap your analysis in <repair_strategy> tags. In your analysis:
1. Quote relevant parts of the error message, additional info, and bump description.
2. List all methods used in the client code and cross-reference them with the bump description.
3. List the specific errors identified.
4. Explicitly state which line(s) contain the error(s).
5. Determine which removed or added library methods are relevant to the fix.
6. Consider multiple potential fixes and their pros/cons.
7. Outline a step-by-step plan for modifying the code while adhering to all constraints.

After your analysis, provide the repaired code wrapped in <repaired_code> tags.

Constraints and requirements:
1. Only modify the client code, not the library.
2. Do not change the function signature.
3. You may create new variables if they improve code readability.
4. Remove the @Override decorator only if the method is not overriding any method in the new version.
5. Do not use removed library methods (marked with '--' in the bump description).
6. You can use added library methods (marked with '++' in the bump description).
7. Return only the fixed failing method, not the complete class code.
8. You must change something in the code.

Ensure that your proposed fix:
- Addresses the specific error
- Adheres to all constraints mentioned above
- Is a complete, compilable code segment that can replace the entire failing client code
- Does not include any explanation or change indicators (like '--' or '++')
