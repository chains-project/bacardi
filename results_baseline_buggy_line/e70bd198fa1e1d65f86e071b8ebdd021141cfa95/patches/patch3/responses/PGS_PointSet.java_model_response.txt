### Changes Made:
1. **Method Call Update**: Changed `tree.query1NN(coords).distance()` to `tree.query1NN(coords).getDistance()` to align with the updated method signature in the `KDTree` class.
2. **Imports**: No changes were needed for imports as they were already correct.
3. **Code Structure**: The overall structure of the class remains unchanged, ensuring that the function signatures and logic are preserved.
