        log.log(Level.INFO, "handling exception : PostNotFoundException");

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Import Verification**: The import statement for `Models` is retained to ensure it is correctly imported from the updated dependency. If the `Models` class is not found, you may need to check the new package structure or replace it with an alternative class that serves a similar purpose.
2. **No Changes to Function Signatures**: The function signatures and annotations remain unchanged as per the requirements.
3. **Logger Initialization**: The commented-out static logger initialization was not necessary for the fix, so it was left as is. The injected logger is used correctly.
4. **Maintaining Existing Code**: All existing code is preserved, as it does not directly cause any compilation or functionality errors. 

This class should now compile correctly with the updated dependencies, assuming the `Models` class is still part of the new library version. If `Models` has been removed or replaced, further adjustments may be necessary based on the new API.
