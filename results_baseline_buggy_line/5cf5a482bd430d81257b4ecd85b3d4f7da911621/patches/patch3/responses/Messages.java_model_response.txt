### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Imports**: The imports for `MvcContext` and `LocaleResolver` have been retained as they are correct for the updated Jakarta EE dependencies. The error messages indicated that the `javax` packages were not found, which suggests that the project should be using the `jakarta` packages instead.
2. **Class Structure**: The overall structure of the class remains unchanged, ensuring that the function signatures and logic are preserved.
3. **Dependency Compatibility**: The class is now aligned with the Jakarta EE specifications, which should resolve the compilation errors related to missing classes and packages. 

This patch should compile correctly with the updated dependencies.
