### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Imports**: The import for `MavenProject` was retained as it is necessary for the class to function correctly. Ensure that the Maven dependencies are correctly set in your `pom.xml` to include the necessary Maven libraries.
2. **Error Handling**: If there are any issues with the `MavenProject` class not being found, ensure that the correct version of the Maven API is included in your project dependencies.
3. **No Function Signature Changes**: The function signatures and existing code structure were preserved as per the requirements. 

Make sure to check your `pom.xml` for the correct Maven dependencies to avoid the "package does not exist" error.
