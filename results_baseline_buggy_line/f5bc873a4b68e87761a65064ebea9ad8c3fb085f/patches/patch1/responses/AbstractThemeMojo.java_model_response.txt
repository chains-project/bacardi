### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Import Statement**: The import statement for `MavenProject` was retained as it was correct. However, if there were any changes in the Maven dependencies that required a different import, it would need to be updated accordingly. In this case, the original import was valid.
2. **No Changes to Function Signatures**: The function signatures were not altered, adhering to the requirement.
3. **No Removal of Code**: Existing code was preserved as it did not cause any compilation or functionality errors.
4. **Dependency Update Consideration**: The analysis did not indicate a need for changes to the method signatures or the removal of the `@Override` annotation, as there were no overriding methods affected by the dependency update.

This class should now compile correctly with the updated dependencies.
