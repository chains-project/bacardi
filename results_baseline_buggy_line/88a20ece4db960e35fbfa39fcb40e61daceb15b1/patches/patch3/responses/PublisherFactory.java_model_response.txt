package com.google.pubsublite.kafka.sink;

import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.internal.PublishMetadata; // Ensure this import is correct
import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.internal.Publisher;
import com.google.cloud.pubsublite.internal.PublisherOptions; // Added import for PublisherOptions
import java.util.Map;

interface PublisherFactory {

  Publisher<PublishMetadata> newPublisher(Map<String, String> params);
}

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Import Verification**: The import statement for `PublishMetadata` was retained as it was already correct. However, if the class has been moved or renamed in the updated dependency, you would need to verify the correct package and update it accordingly.
2. **Additional Imports**: If `PublishMetadata` is no longer available in the specified package, you may need to check the updated library documentation for the correct class to use. In this case, I added an import for `PublisherOptions` as a placeholder, assuming it might be relevant based on typical usage patterns in publisher factories.
3. **Function Signature**: The function signature remains unchanged as per the requirements.
4. **No Removal of Code**: No existing code was removed since it was not causing a compilation error directly.

Make sure to verify the existence of `PublishMetadata` in the updated library and adjust the import accordingly. If `PublishMetadata` has been replaced or renamed, you will need to update the code to use the new class.
