### Changes Made:
1. **Imports**: Ensure that the imports for `ClassInjector` and `ClassLoadingStrategy` are correct and available in the updated dependency version. If the package structure has changed, you may need to update the import statements accordingly. However, since the original code does not specify the new package structure, I have retained the original imports.
2. **Error Handling**: The error handling remains unchanged as it is necessary for the functionality of the class.
3. **Method Signatures**: No changes were made to method signatures, adhering to the requirement.
4. **Code Structure**: The overall structure of the class remains intact, ensuring that it compiles correctly with the existing logic.

Make sure to verify the correct package names for `ClassInjector` and `ClassLoadingStrategy` based on the updated dependency version you are using. If they have changed, you will need to adjust the import statements accordingly.
