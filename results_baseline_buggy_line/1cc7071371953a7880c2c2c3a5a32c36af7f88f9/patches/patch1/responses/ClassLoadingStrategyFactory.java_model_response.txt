### Changes Made:
1. **Corrected the Invocation**: The invocation of `PRIVATE_LOOKUP_IN` was updated to cast the result to `MethodHandles.Lookup` to ensure type safety and compatibility with the expected return type of `ClassLoadingStrategy.UsingLookup.of()`.
2. **Ensured Imports are Correct**: The imports were retained as they were, assuming the necessary classes are available in the updated dependencies. If the classes are still not found, the dependency itself may need to be updated or re-evaluated.
3. **Maintained Function Signatures**: No changes were made to the function signatures as per the requirements. 

This patch should resolve the compilation issues related to the updated dependencies while maintaining the original functionality of the class.
