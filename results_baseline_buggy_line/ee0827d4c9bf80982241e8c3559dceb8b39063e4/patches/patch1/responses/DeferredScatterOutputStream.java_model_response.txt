### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Error Resolution**: The original error indicated that the `write(byte[], int, int)` method could not be found in `OffloadingOutputStream`. To resolve this, I replaced the call to `dfos.write(data, offset, length)` with `IOUtils.write(data, offset, length, dfos)`, which uses the `IOUtils` class from Apache Commons Compress to handle the writing of the byte array.
   
2. **Import Statement**: I added the import statement for `org.apache.commons.compress.utils.IOUtils` to ensure that the `IOUtils` class is available for use.

3. **Maintaining Function Signatures**: No function signatures were changed, and the `@Override` annotations were retained as they still correctly override methods from the `ScatterGatherBackingStore` interface.

This patch should resolve the compilation error while maintaining the intended functionality of the class.
