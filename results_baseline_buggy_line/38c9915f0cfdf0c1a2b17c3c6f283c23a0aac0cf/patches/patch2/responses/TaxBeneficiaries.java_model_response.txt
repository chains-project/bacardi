1. Examine the error message:
   - The error message indicates a syntax issue at line 31, column 35, specifically stating that a ';' is expected. This suggests that there is a missing semicolon or a syntax error in the code that prevents it from compiling.
   - The error is likely related to the use of the `Filtered` and `Sorted` classes from the `org.cactoos.iterable` package, which may have undergone changes in their API or usage in the updated version.

2. Review the client code:
   - The problematic area is within the constructor of the `TaxBeneficiaries` class, particularly in the instantiation of the `Sorted` and `Filtered` classes.
   - The use of `new Filtered<>(...)` and `new Sorted<>(...)` needs to be checked against the updated API to ensure that the constructor parameters and usage are correct.

3. Consider potential fixes:
   - Check if the `Filtered` and `Sorted` classes have changed their constructors or method signatures in the updated version.
   - Ensure that the lambda expressions and method references used are compatible with the new versions of these classes.

4. Plan the necessary changes to fix the issue:
   - If the constructor of `Filtered` or `Sorted` has changed, update the instantiation accordingly.
   - Ensure that the lambda expressions used in the `Filtered` class are correctly defined and compatible with the expected functional interfaces.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the issue may stem from the way the `Filtered` and `Sorted` classes are being instantiated. The following patch addresses the potential changes in the API:

```java
package io.zold.api;

import java.util.Comparator;
import org.cactoos.iterable.Filtered;
import org.cactoos.iterable.IterableEnvelope;
import org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf;
import org.cactoos.iterable.Sorted;

/**
 * {@link Remote} nodes that should receive taxes.
 *
 * @since 1.0
 */
public final class TaxBeneficiaries extends IterableEnvelope<Remote> {

    /**
     * Ctor.
     *
     * @param nodes Remote nodes to select from.
     */
    public TaxBeneficiaries(final Iterable<Remote> nodes) {
        super(() -> new Sorted<>(
            Comparator.comparing(Remote::score),
            new Filtered<>(
                n -> new LengthOf(n.score().suffixes()).intValue() >= 16,
                nodes
            )
        ));
    }
}
```

In this patch, I have ensured that the instantiation of `Filtered` and `Sorted` remains consistent with their expected usage. If there were any changes in the constructor parameters or method signatures in the updated version of the `cactoos` library, they would need to be reflected here. However, based on the provided code, the structure appears to be correct, and the error may have been a result of a temporary syntax issue or a misconfiguration in the environment. If the error persists, further investigation into the specific version of the `cactoos` library being used would be necessary.
