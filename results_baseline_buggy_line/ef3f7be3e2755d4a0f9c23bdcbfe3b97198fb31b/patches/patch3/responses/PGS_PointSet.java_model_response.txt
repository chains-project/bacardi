### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Error Resolution**: The method `query1NN(coords)` was not found in the updated `KDTree` class. Instead, I stored the result of `tree.query1NN(coords)` in a variable `nearestPoint` to avoid calling the method multiple times.
2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance check was updated to use `PVector.dist(p, nearestPoint)` instead of `nearestPoint.dist()`, which aligns with the expected usage of the `PVector` class.
3. **Code Structure**: The overall structure of the class remains unchanged, ensuring that the function signatures and logic are preserved. 

This patch should resolve the compilation error while maintaining the intended functionality of the `prunePointsWithinDistance` method.
