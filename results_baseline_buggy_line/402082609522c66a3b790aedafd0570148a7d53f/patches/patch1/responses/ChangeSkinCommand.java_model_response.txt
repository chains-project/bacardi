```java
package com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.command;

import org.spongepowered.api.command.spec.CommandSpec; // Ensure this import is correct based on the updated dependency

@FunctionalInterface
public interface ChangeSkinCommand {

    CommandSpec buildSpec(); // This method signature remains unchanged
}
``` 

In this case, the error messages indicate that the `CommandSpec` class cannot be found, which suggests that the import statement may be incorrect due to a breaking change in the dependency. Ensure that the `org.spongepowered.api.command.spec.CommandSpec` class exists in the updated version of the Sponge API you are using. If the package structure has changed, you may need to update the import statement accordingly. 

If the class `CommandSpec` has been moved to a different package in the updated version, you would need to replace the import statement with the correct package path. However, since the specific new package path is not provided in the error message, you should verify the current Sponge API documentation or source code to find the correct location of `CommandSpec`. 

If the class still exists in the same package, the provided code should compile correctly.
