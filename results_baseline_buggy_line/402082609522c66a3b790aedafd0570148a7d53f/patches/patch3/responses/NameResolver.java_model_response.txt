```java

import com.github.games647.changeskin.core.shared.task.SharedNameResolver;
import com.github.games647.changeskin.sponge.ChangeSkinSponge;

    @Override

        //todo check skin permissions
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    protected void scheduleDownloader(UUID uuid) {

In this case, the original code was already correct in terms of structure and imports. The error message indicates that the `CommandSource` class could not be found, which typically suggests that the dependency for SpongeAPI has been updated or changed, and the class may have been moved or renamed. 

To resolve this, ensure that the correct version of the SpongeAPI is included in your project dependencies. If the class `CommandSource` has been moved to a different package or renamed in the new version, you would need to update the import statement accordingly. 

If the `CommandSource` class is indeed still part of the SpongeAPI but under a different package, you would need to adjust the import statement to reflect that. However, since the provided code already has the correct import, it suggests that the issue lies with the dependency itself rather than the code structure. 

Make sure to check your project's build configuration (like Maven or Gradle) to ensure that the correct version of the SpongeAPI is being used. If the class has been removed or renamed in the new version, you will need to find the appropriate replacement in the updated API documentation.
