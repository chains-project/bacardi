 Act as an Automatic Program Repair (APR) tool, reply only with code, without explanation.
You are specialized in breaking dependency updates, in which the failure is caused by an external dependency.
To solve the failure you can only work on the client code.
 the following client code fails:
package com.wire.lithium.healthchecks;

import com.codahale.metrics.health.HealthCheck;
import com.wire.lithium.API;
import com.wire.lithium.server.monitoring.MDCUtils;
import com.wire.xenon.tools.Logger;

import okhttp3.OkHttpClient; // updated import
import okhttp3.Response; // updated import

public class Outbound extends HealthCheck {
    private final OkHttpClient client; // updated type

    public Outbound(OkHttpClient client) { // updated type
        this.client = client;
    }

    protected Result check() {
        MDCUtils.put("healthCheck", "Outbound"); // tag the logs with health check
        Logger.debug("Starting Outbound healthcheck");
        API api = new API(client, null);

        try {
            Response response = api.status(); // updated to work with OkHttpClient
            String s = response.body().string(); // updated to work with OkHttpClient
            int status = response.code(); // updated to work with OkHttpClient
            return status == 200 ? Result.healthy() : Result.unhealthy(String.format("%s. status: %d", s, status));
        } catch (Exception e) {
            final String message = String.format("Unable to reach: %s, error: %s", api.getWireHost(), e.getMessage());
            Logger.exception(message, e);
            return Result.unhealthy(message);
        } finally {
            Logger.debug("Finished Outbound healthcheck");
        }
    }
}

 propose a patch that can be applied to the code to fix the issue.
 Return only a complete and compilable class in a fenced code block.
 Do not remove any code that you don't want to update keep it in the code block. Do not use "// ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)" in your response.
 You CANNOT change the function signature of any method but may create variables if it simplifies the code.
 You CAN remove the @Override annotation IF AND ONLY IF the method no longer overrides a method in the updated dependency version.
 If fixing the issue requires addressing missing imports, ensure the correct package or class is used in accordance with the newer dependency version.
 Avoid removing any existing code unless it directly causes a compilation or functionality error.
 Return only the fixed class, ensuring it fully compiles and adheres to these constraints.
